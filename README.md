## What is DC Uploader?

A simple python tool built for ubuntu to create and upload torrents. Debian is unsupported at the moment but hopefully will be soon.

- Checks for duplicates.
- Creates torrents.
- Automatically adds uploaded torrent to client by copying the created .torrent file to client watch directory.
- Takes screenshots with movie thumbnailer and uploads to image host.
  - Works on rar'd content as well. Only done when no sample is found.
- Added the mediainfo to the uploaded torrent.
- Automatically enable HTTPS with either certbot (installed via pip) or a self-signed certificate.
    - Support for cloudflare DNS challenge via cloudflare API token.
    - Sets up automatic certbot cert renewal and certbot updates, if not already existing.
- Gets video game information from IGDB (API key required).
- Gets movie/show information from TMDB (API key required).
- Automatically edit .torrent from source content tracker instead of generating new .torrent with torf.

## Install from source

1. Download the release tarball.

2. Untar to current directory with `tar -xvzf dc_uploader-[RELEASE_VERSION].tar.gz`.

3. cd into the unzipped directory (not strictly necessary, but allows you to call install with just `./install.sh`)

4. Run install.sh, which will install the necessary packages and python virtual environments. Run `install.sh -h` or `install.sh --help` for help. Running install.sh with no arguments will install in interactive mode, but the only thing the script will ask for is a domain name. The domain name can be provided with args:
   - `install.sh -d [fully qualified domain name]` or 
   - `install.sh --domain [fully qualified domain name]`
   - Run `chmod +x install.sh` to make install script executable if you're getting permission errors when trying to run `install.sh`

5. Modify config.ini with required settings:
    - USERNAME
    - PASSWORD
    - CAPTCHA_PASSKEY
    - LOGINTXT
    - APIKEY
    - CLIENT_ID
    - CLIENT_SECRET
    - SOURCEFOLDER
    - ANNOUNCEURL
    - WATCHFOLDER
    - DATADIR
6. You're done. All user scripts are in the scripts directory.
   - Note: if you ever change your password, delete your cookie.tmp that is stored in the `files` directory, otherwise you will be unable to upload the completed torrent.

## Docker
### Docker Compose

Example compose file:
```
services:
    dc-uploader:
        image: ghcr.io/digicore404/dc_uploader:latest
        container_name: dc-uploader
        entrypoint: tail # IMPORTANT
        command: -f /dev/null # IMPORTANT
        ports:
            - 5000:5000 # Web app port. Only needed if you use web app, needs to reflect what is in config.ini
        cap_add:
        # Only required if you upload rar'd content
            - SYS_ADMIN
        devices:
        # Only required if you upload rar'd content
            - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
        volumes:
            - ./dc-uploader/config.ini:/dc_uploader/config.ini:ro
            - ./dc-uploader/queue.txt:/dc_uploader/scripts/queue.txt:ro # Optional
            - /data/torrents:/data/torrents # This is an example DATADIR
        restart: unless-stopped
```

Essentially, you want to mount at least the following files/directories:
- config.ini: The config file. This is where all the settings are stored - pretty self-explanatory.
- queue.txt: The queue file. This is where you can store a list of directories to upload. If you don't use queues, ignore it.
- Mounting DATADIR correctly is the only tricky part for [discrete directory](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#discrete-directories) users. Docker treats all mounts as distinct filesystems inside the container, even if on the host they are on the same filesystem. As such, if you want to use hardlinks, you need to mount the common "ancestor" to DATADIR and where you're trying to hardlink from. Even if you're not following the trash guides, it's a good idea to give their hardlinking tutorial a [read](https://trash-guides.info/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/)

For those new to Docker, ./[somedirectory] means [somedirectory] is relative pathed to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located. You can also use absolute paths if you want, but it's not necessary if you have the docker-compose.yml file in the same directory as the host-mounted container data.

#### What are the entrypoint and command stuff?

Since this is primarily a CLI tool, there's no long-running program to use for the entrypoint. The entrypoint is thus set to `tail -f /dev/null`, which is a common way to keep a container running by making it tail /dev/null endlessly. This allows you to run commands in the container interactively if you want or via docker exec, while still keeping the container alive when you're not doing anything. Eventually, we'll likely change the entrypoint to run the web app once it's functional, but for now, this is the simplest way to keep the container alive.

#### I'm new to docker, how do I run the script in the container?

`docker exec -it dc-uploader ./upload.sh [/path/to/directory] [OPTION]`

Otherwise, it's identical to normal [usage](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)

## config.ini settings

Do not change the headers or location of the settings, or change the location of config.ini. It MUST remain in the program's root directory, otherwise - bugs. If it is not mentioned below, just leave it its default.

- user: If you are exposing the web app to the wider Internet, you should choose a more secure username.
- password: If you are exposing the web app to the wider Internet, you absolutely must choose a more secure password.
- port: If you want to run the web app on a different port than 5000.
- USERNAME: Your site username.
- PASSWORD: Your site password.
- CAPTCHA_PASSKEY: This is your passkey for the site.
- LOGINTXT: Your site username (again).
- FREELEECH: Set uploaded torrent to freeleech. Vast majority of users have no actual control over the freeleech status of their uploads, so the majority of users can just leave this at default and ignore it.
- ANONYMOUS: Set uploaded torrents to anonymous or not. Defaults to 1 (true).
- APIKEY: Your TMDB API key to search for meta info.
- CLIENT_ID: Your IGDB client ID to search for video game info.
- CLIENT_SECRET: Your IGDB client secret to search for video game info
- HASHER: What hash program to use. Can be either `torf` or `mkbrr`
- SOURCEFOLDER: directory where .torrent files from source torrent site are downloaded to. If you are always rehashing new .torrent files when you upload (e.g. EDIT_TORRENT is set to false), this directory is largely irrelevant and can be just set to `tmp/`.
    - If EDIT_TORRENT is set to true, it will edit the torrent instead of creating a new one, which saves time.
- ANNOUNCEURL: Your personal announce URL.
- WATCHFOLDER: Path to the directory where .torrent file for the uploaded torrent is placed for the client to import, e.g., /uploaders/torrentwatch.
- DATADIR: Path to where the downloaded torrent data is stored, e.g., /uploaders/complete. If you like to sort your downloads into tracker/category/etc specific directory (e.g. due to using an *arr stack), see [discrete directories](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#discrete-directories).

## Usage

### upload.sh usage for manual uploading via command line

#### upload.sh "/full/path/to/torrent/directory" [OPTION]

If one of the required settings in config.ini aren't set, script will fail and tell you what isn't set.

Let's say you have a directory you would like to upload:

/home/torrentdata/this.is.a.nice.movie-grp

With the actual movie inside being:

/home/torrentdata/this.is.a.nice.movie-grp/this.is.a.nice.movie-grp.mkv

The DATADIR would be /home/torrentdata

You would run: `upload.sh "/home/torrentdata/tracker1/this.is.a.nice.movie-grp"`

By default, the program assumes that the data to be uploaded already exists in DATADIR. See [discrete directories](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#discrete-directories) if you want to upload directories that are outside DATADIR. If you pass `upload.sh` one of the optional arguments, but the directory is already in DATADIR, it just ignores the argument, thus avoiding duplicating data.

#### Optional arguments:
-h, --help: Prints help. Called via `upload.sh -h` or `upload.sh --help`.

--req: Request ID to fill with this upload, e.g. `upload.sh "/home/torrentdata/this.is.a.nice.movie-grp" --req 123`. You cannot fill your own request.

Following arguments are primarily used when user is using discrete directories.

-l, --ln: Hardlinks provided directory to DATADIR. If hardlink fails, fallback to symlink.

-c, --cp: Copies provided directory to DATADIR

-m, --mv: Moves provided directory to DATADIR

### Upload queue

If you have many directories you want to upload at once, but don't want to manually run `upload.sh` so many times, use `queue_upload.sh`. Create a file and write the same directory path you'd normally use for `upload.sh`, with each directory on a separate line. Then, just call `queue_upload.sh [QUEUE FILE] [OPTION]`. 

Use `queue_upload.sh` exactly the same as you would `upload.sh`, just that instead of providing a directory, you provide a queue file. The only difference is that link/copy/move argument is mandatory, not optional. Don't worry, again, if the directory already exists in DATADIR, the argument is ignored for that directory, as `upload.sh` is what is called under the hood and already has such checks.

The queue file provided to `queue_upload.sh` can either be a full absolute path or a relative path relative to `queue_upload.sh`. e.g. `queue_upload.sh some_queue_file.txt [OPTION]` if queue file is located in the same folder as `queue_upload.sh`.

If you want to see a log of what was successful during the last run, the success/failure of each queue item is logged in `files/queue_upload.log`.

Since this might take a while, it might be a good idea to execute this as a detached screen. See [FAQ](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#faq).

### Web app usage

#### Web app is currently unsupported and its functionality cannot be guaranteed. In fact, its somewhat nonfunctional.

Note: Web app usage is entirely optional. The upload tool can be used entirely from the command line.

start.sh will start the web server on the specified port specified during install. Starts in a detatched screen session named "dc-uploader". Web app is not necessary - you can never start it and use this tool entirely from the command line via `upload.sh`.

shutdown.sh shuts down the web server and ends the screen session.
    
1. Run `start.sh`. If one of the required settings in config.ini aren't set, it will fail to start and tell you what isn't set.
2. Navigate to `https://[hostname.domain]:5000`, assuming you used the default port. If you specified a different port during install, use that. If it's just running locally, `localhost:5000` will work as well - the app binds to `0.0.0.0`.
3. Login with username/password found in config.ini (default: admin/p@ssword).
4. Update the relevant settings as needed.

If using discrete directories, web app requires users to manually copy/hardlink/symlink/move to DATADIR. Hopefully future versions will automate the copy/hardlink/symlink process when using discrete directory.

You can connect to the screen session with `screen -r dc-uploader`. Detatch from the screen with `CTRL + A` then `D`. Logs are stored in files/webapp.log.

## Discrete directories

If you just download all your torrents to one directory, just set DATADIR to that directory and ignore this section. For those who keep their torrent directories neat, read on.

Let's say you have sorted your downloaded torrents into neat little discrete directories, such as based on category, tracker, etc. You'll need to use one of the args (e.g. --ln) when calling `upload.sh`.

What this means is that you will need to create an upload specific directory to use as the "base" DATADIR. For example, you have your torrents sorted into two directories:

`/data/movie/someneatmovie/someneatmovie.mkv`

`/data/tv/someneatshow/someneatshows01e01.mkv,someneatshows01e02.mkv,etc`

DATADIR can't be both /data/movie *and* /data/tv at the same time, so what do you do? You create:

`/data/uploads`

Now, you set DATADIR to `/data/uploads`, and --ln/cp/mv become non-optional arguments. You *must* pick one. Then, if you run `upload.sh "/data/movie/someneatmovie" --ln/cp/mv`, it will use the selected option to re-create the directory in `/data/uploads`, resulting in a final directory of `/data/uploads/someneatmovie`. If you use --ln, this second copy of the directory takes no additional disk space. Also known as black magic.

The alternative is to update config.ini's DATADIR every time you want to upload from a different directory, but who wants to do that?

## Permissions

The install.sh script must be run as root, since it has to install prerequisites. The rest of the scripts can be run as a non-root user and without sudo, provided that the user running those scripts has read and write permissions to:

- Program's entire root directory (e.g. dc_uploader)
  - `chown -R [USER] dc_uploader` if you want to be sure, but usually not necessary if this is the same user that downloaded dc_uploader.
- DATADIR
- WATCHFOLDER

## Uninstall :(

To remove just the program, simply delete the program folder. The python virtual environment path is /venv/dc_uploader

To remove the dependencies installed via apt, run apt remove. Double check if there are things that you don't want to uninstall, especially fuse3. Packages possibly installed by this script: 
- build-essential mtn mediainfo fuse3 libfuse-dev screen software-properties-common autoconf gpg

To remove rar2fs:

`rm /usr/local/bin/rar2fs`

Any installed repo's besides the standard apt repo's, which should be just mtn and mediainfo, are stored in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`, with their gpg keys stored in `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d`

## FAQ

#### Q: I don't want the script to take over my session, I have other stuff to do. What do I do?

A: Luckily, screen is installed by the script! You can simply execute the command as a detached screen session:

`screen -dmS [SCREEN_NAME] ./queue_upload.sh testqueue.txt --ln`

`screen -dmS [SCREEN_NAME] ./upload.sh /some/directory/ --ln`

etc. If you want to log the screen's output into some.log located in the program's files directory, you can do that too:

`screen -dms [SCREEN_NAME] -L -Logfile files/some.log ./queue_upload.sh...`

`screen -dms [SCREEN_NAME] -L -Logfile files/some.log ./upload.sh...`

Essentially, just add `screen -dmS [SCREEN_NAME]` to the start of your command and it'll execute that command in a detached screen. The screen will automatically terminate once the command finishes. You can omit the `S [SCREEN_NAME]` if you don't want to name your screen.

`screen -ls` to list all your screen sessions and that the screen you just created is actually running.  Do be careful to know that if there is an error in running the requested command, the detached screen immediately terminates, since the command exited, and it will NOT print any errors. When in doubt, run the screen command in attached mode first by omitting the `d` argument, then detaching with `CTRL + A` then `D`.

#### Q: After my torrent is uploaded, where does the actual torrent in the client expect the data to be?

A: This depends on how you set up the watch directory. By using a watch directory, the client adds the .torrent file to the client similar to a user adding a torrent, so it depends on how you've set your client up.

#### Q: I use discrete directories, but I want to add it to a download-then-uploadToDCC automation pathway, how do I do that?

A: Assuming you have created an upload directory as directed by the [discrete directories](https://github.com/DigiCore404/dc_uploader/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#discrete-directories) section, just pass the torrent content path to upload.sh with one of the relevant arguments. The script is the one that handles the linking/copying. You most likely should not use `--mv` in automation since it can break the source torrent which you might still need to seed.

**Example with rtorrent:**

```
schedule2 = watch_directory_source,5,5,load.start=/uploaders/sourcewatch/*.torrent
schedule2 = watch_directory,5,5,load.start=/uploaders/dcwatch/*.torrent
schedule2 = tied_directory,6,5,start_tied=
schedule2 = untied_directory,7,5,stop_untied=
schedule2 = untied_directory,8,5,remove_untied=

method.set_key=event.download.finished,move_complete, \
"execute2={/path/to/dc_upload/upload.sh,$d.get_base_path=,--ln/--cp}"
```

Here, sourcewatch is SOURCEFOLDER, dcwatch is WATCHFOLDER, DATADIR would be whatever folder rtorrent downloads torrents into, and $d.get_base_path= is the directory to be uploaded.

**Example with qBittorrent:**

Navigate to "Downloads" in settings. Scroll to bottom, check "Run external program on torrent finished". Input:

`/path/to/dc_uploader/upload.sh %F [ARG as needed]`

If you already have some command executing, just chain the command:

`[some pre-existing command, e.g. cross-seed] && /path/to/dc_uploader/upload.sh %F [ARG as needed]`

`&&` will only execute the upload if the previous command is successful. If you want upload regardless of the success of the previous command, replace `&&` with `;`

#### Q: What happens if I pass the script a file instead of a directory?

A: A polar bear mauls you. Assuming you survive, the script will fail - this tool does not support file uploads. The tool does not create subdirectories within the .torrent file.

#### Q: Will logs grow indefinitely?

For some, yes. However, for the two things that tend to generate a lot of logs, namely the webapp and queue_upload.sh, they are rotated to [somelog].log.old when they reach 2MiB and 1MiB, respectively. Even for the logs that don't have automatic rotation, logs take up very little space, and you can always just manually delete them from the files directory if you want to.

#### Q: What happens if I pass the script the path of something already in DATADIR?

A: Everything will proceed as normal. It'll just use the pre-existing directory rather than link/copy/move anything.

#### Q: When does the tool fallback to symlinking?

A: The primary limitation of hardlinking is that the source and intended destination must be on the same filesystem - e.g. it can't hardlink from one hard drive to another, from one hard drive to a SMB/NFS mount, etc. When the tool detects that a hardlink can't be done, it tries again using symlinks.

### Q: Can I use this tool on windows?

A: No you'll be missing a lot of the required tools. Instead, look into [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once WSL is running, just mount your torrent parent folder to the WSL environment through /etc/fstab and you should be fine. Treat it like a second computer.
